# Localazy Kotlin Trivia 2

We love Kotlin here at [Localazy](https://localazy.com) for our Android and backend development and from time to time, we use it just for fun. Let's play with us! 

This project is a [source code for our Kotlin Trivia](https://localazy.com/blog/kotlin-trivia-2).

## The trivia

```kotlin
// Add 3 lines of code outside the main function
// to make the code below print: Thank you, JetBrains!

fun main() {
    Localazy `❤️` Kotlin
}
```
